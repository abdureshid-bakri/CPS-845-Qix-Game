# The Qix Game
The game starts with a large empty playfield and the player is located on the outer boundary. A creature called the Qix moves freely inside the field and the player moves along the boundary and can push inward to draw lines, creating a trail. If the player successfully connects the trail back to a boundary, the game “seals” the enclosed area. The sealed area becomes claimed, reducing the free space where Qix can move. The goal is to claim a certain percentage of the playfield (example: 50%).
